[Isaac watching the sign rise]
	Isaac, after defeating the angel that fell, watched its burning soul rise back up above. He heard a voice, saying, 

[God talking effect from intro w isaac]
	"My dear Isaac. You may feel trapped, however 
	
	[Heart shows and pops]
		know that my forgiveness is bountiful and my love will never fade. 
	
	Free yourself of this curse you have brought upon yourself, and recognize that you, too, bathe in my light from above." 

[Isaac, thoughtful]
	Isaac, hearing these words, found that his hope may be gone, 

[Isaac looking at the chest]
	but he can still achieve salvation.

[Isaac looking happily at the chest]
	And so Isaac, seeing this freedom in his head, 

[Isaac climbing in the chest]
	finally was able to rest in peace, ridding him of the shadows he saw around him 

[Isaac closing the chest]
	as he closed his eyes for the last time.
