[Isaac watching the sign rise]
	Isaac, after defeating the angel that fell, watched its burning soul rise back up above. He heard a voice, saying, 

[God talking effect from intro w isaac]
	"My dear Isaac. You may feel trapped, however 
	
	[Heart shows and pops]
		know that my forgiveness is bountiful and my love will never fade. 
	
	Free yourself of this curse you have brought upon yourself, and recognize that you, too, bathe in my light from above." 

[Isaac, thoughtful]
	Isaac, hearing these words, realized that he will never escape the place he has feared for so long; 

[Isaac looking at the chest]
	however, he will always be free if he lets himself be free inside his head.

[Isaac looking happily at the chest]
	And so Isaac, seeing this freedom in his head, 

[Isaac climbing in the chest]
	finally was able to rest in peace, freeing himself of the shadows he saw around him 

[Isaac closing the chest]
	as he closed his eyes for the last time.
